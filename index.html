  <h1>Wormholes are speculative structures that link faraway points in spacetime.
Imagine that you are travelling through the cosmos, with the intention of heading
towards a distant planet across the universe. However, your estimated arrival time
would be lightyears away — a frustrating and tiresome journey, if you could even live
that long. Wormholes can theoretically shorten your journey almost instantly, but
you would miss the sights of the strange but beautiful planets that the vast galaxies
have to offer.
<br>
<br>
The story of <i>Folding Beijing</i> draws parallels to the concept of the wormhole, in which
the protagonist experiences a transcendence from a world of poverty to a life of
luxury within a day — a journey that would have otherwise taken a portion of a lifetime.
<br>
<br>
Now, you as a reader can choose to read this story, accompanied by tales from <i>Invisible Planets</i>, according to whichever you see
as an important factor while travelling:
